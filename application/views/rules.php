<h1>THE JORDAN'S &amp; RYVITA COMPANY, a division of ABF GRAIN PRODUCTS LTD. 2015 RYVITA CANADA TIN DESIGN INVITATIONAL STUDENT ART COMPETITION</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">COMPETITION RULES AND GUIDELINES</h2>
<h3>1. WHO IS RYVITA CANADA</h3>
<p>
The first RYVITA&reg; bakery was established in Birmingham in 1932, it made crispbread using the same principles we use today ­ the finest British Rye ingredients with no added yeast. In 1940, the RYVITA&reg; Co. Ltd was bought by Rowntree and products were made in different locations in order to over come wartime zoning. 
In 1949, after the war, a factory with three continuous baking ovens was commissioned in Poole, Dorset. Also, in 1949, Garfield Weston bought the RYVITA&reg; Company Ltd. This is still the site of the current RYVITA&reg; factory, and Garfield Weston's original company, Associated British Foods, still owns RYVITA&reg; ­ a consistent relationship with Poole &amp; ABF for over 60 years! 
Since establishing Poole &amp; being bought by ABF, RYVITA&reg; has had several further milestones in its history ­ opening a mill in 1968 to provide all the Rye flour for your favourite RYVITA&reg; Crispbread and expanding into Canada, Sweden and Australia.

There will be two (2) runner up prizes of $500 in tuition credit for the second and third place submissions.   [In the event that any of the winners are in their final year or term of their program at one of the participating schools set out below, Ryvita Canada may, in its sole discretion, award a cash prize equivalent to the tuition credit to the winner(s).]
